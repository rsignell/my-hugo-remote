Welcome to my new static website! This page was created using **Markdown** and automatically deployed with **GitHub Actions**.

This is the content of my first post. It's a great way to publish articles and stories quickly. You can use standard Markdown syntax like:

* **Bold** and *Italic* text.
* Lists.
* [Links](https://gohugo.io/).
* Images.

Feel free to edit this file and add more content!
